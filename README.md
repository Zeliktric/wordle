# Wordle by Zeliktric

This is my implementation of the popular wordle game :D  

## Getting Started
Simply download this repo, and run `npm install` to install all the node modules.  
If you don't have node installed, you can try to run the following steps:
```
winget install Schniz.fnm

fnm env --use-on-cd | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

fnm use --install-if-missing 20

node -v (check if it works)
```
Then once everything is installed, run `npm start` or `npm run start` (allows you to run it on mobile)  

Thank you!
